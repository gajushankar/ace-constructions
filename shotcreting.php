				<p>
				Shotcrete is concrete (or sometimes mortar) conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected at high velocity onto a surface, as a construction technique. It is reinforced by conventional steel rods, steel mesh, and/or fibers. Fiber reinforcement (steel or synthetic) is also used for stabilization in applications such as slopes or tunneling. </p>
				<p>
				Shotcrete is usually an all-inclusive term for both the wet-mix and dry-mix versions. In pool construction, however, the term "shotcrete" refers to wet-mix and "gunite" to dry-mix. In this context, these terms are not interchangeable (see "Shotcrete vs. gunite" discussion below).</p>
				<p>
				Shotcrete is placed and compacted at the same time, due to the force with the nozzle. It can be sprayed onto any type or shape of surface, including vertical or overhead areas.</p>

				<h4>Dry Mix</h4>
				<p>
				The dry mix method involves placing the dry ingredients into a hopper and then conveying them pneumatically through a hose to the nozzle. The nozzleman controls the addition of water at the nozzle. The water and the dry mixture is not completely mixed, but is completed as the mixture hits the receiving surface. This requires a skilled nozzleman, especially in the case of thick or heavily reinforced sections. Advantages of the dry mix process are that the water content can be adjusted instantaneously by the nozzleman, allowing more effective placement in overhead and vertical applications without using accelerators. The dry mix process is useful in repair applications when it is necessary to stop frequently, as the dry material is easily discharged from the hose.
				</p>

				<h4>Wet Mix</h4>
				<p>
				Wet-mix shotcrete involves pumping of a previously prepared concrete, typically ready-mixed concrete, to the nozzle. Compressed air is introduced at the nozzle to impel the mixture onto the receiving surface. The wet-process procedure generally produces less rebound, waste (when material falls to the floor), and dust compared to the dry-mix process. The greatest advantage of the wet-mix process is all the ingredients are mixed with the water and additives required, and also larger volumes can be placed in less time than the dry process.
